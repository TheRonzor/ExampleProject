# Each .py file in this folder would be dedicated to a single purpose
# I.e., 
#  - a file for functions related to making data
#  - a file for functions related to processing data
#  - a file for functions related to visualizing data
#  - maybe another file for shared functionality/constants/settings that all the other modules need
